# Text Analysis

In this project, our objective is to extract data from the URLs specified in the INPUT.xlsx file and store the information in individual Txt files. Each Txt file will contain the sentences extracted from the corresponding URL. Subsequently, we will conduct sentiment analysis on each Txt file to calculate several sentiment metrics, including the Positive score, Negative score, Polarity score, Subjective score, Average sentence length, Percentage of complex words, FOG index, Average number of words per sentence, Complex word count, Word Count, Syllables per word, Personal pronouns, and Average word length. Lastly, we will record these sentiment scores in the OUTPUT.xlsx file to facilitate further analysis and processing.
